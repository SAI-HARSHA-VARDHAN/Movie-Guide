# Movie-Guide
Why do we need? Movie Guide App is using 'Puppeteer' a node library for Web scraping(Fetching movie details). The main concept of app is to make movie selection easy and better based on your present location. You may several times fina a problem of finding a good movie near you. If you go to any new place and you don't know what are movies around you. You may see that some of movie in Paytm are not shown in Book my show and vice versa. To solve this on just one click it gives details of all movies near you. And no need to open any other website for movie details. All other required details like IMDB rating, direction,plot,actors also pulled from IMDB.com. So just on one click you can find what are all movies near you with all required details. How is it implemented? All the frontend is done using HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT,JQUERY,ANGULAR JS,BOOTSTRAP 4 AND EJS TEMPLATES. In Backend I have used Node Js framework. I did main part,that is Scraping information by using "Puppeteer" library.
